====================================================

Unworkable is a BSD-licensed BitTorrent implementation for UNIX written
from-scratch in C.  It uses libevent for scalable asynchronous networking and
the mmap() system call for local data access.  Some of the goals of the project
include (in no particular order) high code quality, efficiency, simplicity and
security.

FEATURES
========

Unworkable is still in an early stage of development, and is far behind most
other BitTorrent implementations.  However, it is usable for some basic things
and the source code is quite minimal (4,000 lines of C compared to rTorrent's
40,000+ of C++).

Current state:

Unworkable currently lacks support for the following:

    * HTTP/1.1 client. Many trackers do not correctly support HTTP/1.0 so
      downloads will not work.
    * Encryption.
    * Trackerless (DHT) operation.
    * Probably lots of other stuff.

BUILDING
========

Unworkable will build cleanly on OpenBSD (tested on i386, amd64, zaurus,
sparc64, macppc) without any additional dependencies beyond the base install.
Simply type 'make'.

On other platforms, you must use the SCons (http://www.scons.org) build tool.
After installing scons, type 'scons' to compile. Make sure you have libevent
and OpenSSL installed.  If you get it working on other platforms, please let me
know and send along any portability diffs.  It is known to work on at least
FreeBSD 6.2, Ubuntu Linux 8.04, Centos 5, Fedora 7 (on EC 2), Gentoo Linux,
Arch Linux, Mandriva Linux 2008.1. Mac OS X, Solaris 10 and Windows XP (cygwin).
